# react-crux-examples

This repository contains all examples for [React Crux](https://github.com/curefit/react-crux).

Live demo of all examples can be seen at [React Crux Live Examples](https://curefit.github.io/react-crux-examples/).

This demo website has been built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### How to Run Locally
- git clone https://curefit.github.io/react-crux-examples/
- cd react-crux-examples
- yarn
- yarn run start
- Local server will start running on http://localhost:3000

_Note : Since the examples have only client side code, the create, modify and delete calls will fail. To make them run, start a server which listens to /models_
